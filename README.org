* SilverMUD: The Hackable Terminal-Top Roleplaying Game!
SilverMUD is a setting-agnostic multiplayer roleplaying game which is played
over the internet. It gives a gamemaster the same flexibility they have to
improvise and create content as they would have at a table-top, by allowing
game content to be programmed and altered on-the-fly, using an integrated Scheme
interpreter. It can be played as a multi-user dungeon, or a "terminal-top"
roleplaying game, depending on how you decide to configure it.
