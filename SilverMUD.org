* SilverMUD: The Hackable Terminal-Top Roleplaying Game.
SilverMUD is a tool for creating engaging and communal stories, all over the
world through the internet. It's designed to give a gamemaster the same power
to improvise that they have at the table, through simple programming and
easy-to-understand structures.
